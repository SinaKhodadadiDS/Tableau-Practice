# Eniac Brazil Expansion Analysis

## Project Overview

### Business Questions
Eniac is assessing a potential partnership with a Brazilian delivery company, Magist. Two key questions drive this analysis:
1. **Does Magist have experience with high-value, high-tech products?**
2. **Are Magist’s delivery times suitable to maintain Eniac’s customer satisfaction standards?**

Magist provided a snapshot of their database for analysis, which serves as the basis of this project.

## Data and Tools
